00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The last basic operation we can perform on
relational tables is aggregation on top of

2
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.000
a table. There are nicely done here two examples
of early materialization and late materialization.

3
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Since we have everything coded in integers,
in columns, in a column store, we do late

4
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:43.000
materialization and we can just jump in how
this works. Basically you should know already

5
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
how it works

6
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We want to do this here: SELECT city, COUNT(*)
FROM world_population WHERE gender =”m”

7
00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:00.000
AND country=”GER” GROUP BY city. If we
walk through playing on a LEGO-Level of the

8
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:26.000
system then we do parallel; we learned already
we should do it the other way; […].

9
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:35.000
So we should do this first here with the predicate
“GER” we go in, lookup, find GER is 68

10
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000
in the dictionary and we have a ValueID 68.
We do the same with “m” (male), look it

11
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
up and we get 0.

12
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:54.000
We have two results, we have four Germans
and these are the males. And we can AND them

13
00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.000
now and so the remaining position vector is
1-4.

14
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Whether this is done in parallel or whether
both vectors are created and then ANDed; it’s

15
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
a minor implementation issue. We continue
now.

16
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:25.000
After we have this, we apply this now on the
vector of city and count now for the ones

17
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:33.000
1, 2 and 4 how many are in 443 and how many
are in 357. 1 and 2.

18
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And the last one is we materialize now back
1 and 2, we look it up and we find as Bonn

19
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and Berlin and the real result is now Bonn:
1 and Berlin: 2.

20
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:57.000
This is how the machine works: tuck, tuck,
tuck, tuck. And each tuck is one 2.5 billionth

21
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.000
of a second. This is the speed with which
the machine is working. And again you can

22
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:13.000
see if we can distinguish the Berliners out
the 8 billion using an index as a huge advantage,

23
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
if we have to go through all 8 billion to
find the Berliners, it is four times slower

24
00:03:18.000 --> 00:05:18.000
on average.
